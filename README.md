Assignment Description:
In the second week of the course, I learnt how to use inheritance and polymorphism and how to create new classes based on existing classes. For homework, I created the Snowflake class, where the snowflake's trunk and branches, as well as the decorations on the branches, were randomly generated. I drew two layers, one layer that constantly generates random snowflakes falling at the back, and one layer that is a dynamic centre transparent foreground layer, and added background music to create the effect of a crystal ball.

Assignment Description:
In the third week of the course I studied Vector and learned about many use cases, including creations by artists and programmers that mimic natural phenomena such as congregating, swarming or other collective behaviours observed in the natural world. Therefore, I created a kitten Boid system for my assignment, where mouse clicks randomly generate different styles of kittens that follow Vector. In addition, to make the image richer, I added a background, and a sound when the mouse click generates the kittens.

Assignment Description:
The theme of my midterm assignment was falling. When people feel anxious for various reasons, they often feel that they are being oppressed and consumed by some kind of pressure, and if they are unable to adjust themselves in time, they can easily fall into the abyss of internal conflict.
Therefore I used what I learned in class about boid to make the limbs of the figure in the centre of the canvas turn into particles and then fall until they disappear. At the same time, I added music and random forces to make swirls of naturally occurring particles in the background, which also interact with the mouse. Visualising emotions while allowing the person interacting to experience being in an anxious state.

Assignment Description:
In week 7 of the course, I learnt to convert text fonts into arrays of dots and manipulate those dots using different effect functions. For the coursework I experimented using my own name, uploading fonts that I thought were interesting and converting them to points that could be interacted with the mouse. Also, the font colour changes over time, and I added sound interaction, where the position of the mouse is related to the volume level of the music, to make the whole picture look more electronic.
